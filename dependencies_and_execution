Install python 2.7, pip from python.org

Once these two are installed then use pip to install these following modules
pip install django
pip install beautifulsoup
pip install bs4
pip install unirest
pip install requests
pip install tweepy
pip install collections
pip install json
pip install urllib2
pip install lxml
pip install pickle
pip install re
pip install selenium


Execution:
Go to sentiment_analysis folder and execute the following command:
python manage.py runserver
A localhost server will start running at '127.0.0.1:8000'
Visit this over a browser, preferrably google chrome

If at all after execution the program throws some error of type "{package_name} module not found",
then it is because of some dependency. Execute command "pip install {package_name}" to install that package. Inconvenience regretted.
